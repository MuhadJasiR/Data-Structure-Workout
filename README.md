# DSA Workout in Dart 🏋️‍♂️🚀

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations in **Dart**. It is designed to help developers and coding enthusiasts strengthen their problem-solving skills using Dart.

## 📌 What You'll Find
- ✅ Implementations of fundamental **data structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- ✅ Common **algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.)
- ✅ **LeetCode, CodeForces, and Interview Questions** solutions in Dart
- ✅ Well-documented code with **explanations and time complexities**
- ✅ Test cases to validate implementations

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- Ensure you have a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### Run Dart Code
To execute a specific Dart file, use:
```sh
dart run path/to/file.dart
```
